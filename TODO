* Documentation
** Write a complete User Guide.
** Write a complete Developer Guide.
** Create FAQ

* Testing
** GUI regression
** Regression should test automatically for each Installer type that depending on the location of the install (Local, System, User...), only the correct directories are altered.
** Regression should warn when plugins don't have regression test cases

* Development
** In the dependenciesloader dialog, test internet connection before proposing installing Gems and Dlls.
** DependenciesLoaderDialog: The tree should have a little context menu for setting the decisions to ignore/specify directory/install-><Different locations>
** Implement a better looking ProgessDialog for DependenciesLoaderDialog
** Separate CommonTools in an alternative package
