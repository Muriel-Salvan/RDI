* Testing
** Regression should test automatically for each Installer type that depending on the location of the install (Local, System, User...), only the correct directories are altered.
** Regression should warn when plugins don't have regression test cases
** Add cases were part of Testers are resolved (do GUIs correctly take the resolved ones into account ?)
